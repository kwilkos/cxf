Apache CXF 2.0 M1 Release Notes

Apache CXF 2.0 M1 release delivers the merge of the Celtix project
(http://celtix.objectweb.org) and the Xfire project (http://xfire.codehaus.org). 
This release includes all major features of both the Celtix and the Xfire
projects:
    * JAX-WS 2.0 implementation
    * Transports: HTTP 1.1, HTTPS, and JMS
    * Full SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 implementation, with MTOM/XOP support
    * JAXB 2.0 databinding support
    * StAX-based XML streaming
    * WS-Addressing support
    * JCA 1.0 Support
    * Spring support, including spring-based configuration and spring-based
      lightweight container
    * Servlet container support
    * Complete tooling support, including wsdl2java and java2wsdl, plus a
      bunch of other convenient tools.
    * RESTful web service support

2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Apache CXF, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 Development Kit
    * Apache ant 1.6

2.1 Java 5 Development Kit

You must install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0, which can be downloaded from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

After installing the JDK, set or modify the following environment variables:

    * JAVA_HOME -- set this environment variable
      to point at the root directory of the JDK 5.0 installation.

    * PATH -- make sure that your PATH includes: 
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin  (Windows) 
      $JAVA_HOME/bin   (UNIX)

2.2 Apache Ant 1.6.5

To run samples included in the binary distribution of Apache CXF, you must
install the Apache Ant 1.6.5 build utility, which can be downloaded from:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After installing Apache Ant, add the <AntInstallDir>/bin directory to your PATH.

For more details, see the Apache CXF Installation Guide.


3. Building samples

Building the samples included in the binary distribution is easy. Change to
the samples directory and follow the build instructions in the README.txt file 
included with each sample.

4. Known Problems

3.1 HTTP
There is an issue with Jetty HTTP that prevents Apache CXF from being able to 
shut down the actual port listener.  If you programmatically remove the last endpoint
published on a port, the listener remains running on the port, but only 404
(page not found) errors are served to subsequent client connections.

3.2 Schema Definitions
There is no support for nillable elements in XML Schema and xsi:nil attributes
in XML documents.

4. Reporting Problems

If you have any problems or want to send feedback of any kind, please e-mail the
cxf dev list, cxf-dev@incupator.apache.org. 

5. Specific issues, features, and improvements fixed in the 
CXF 2.0 M1 release:
