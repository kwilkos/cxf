Welcome to Apache Incubator CXF!
======================
Apache Incubator CXF simplifies the construction, integration, and flexible 
reuse of technical and business components using a standards-based, 
service-oriented architecture (SOA). It provides a pluggable architecture that 
supports not only XML but also non-XML bindings in combination with any type 
of transport. It also supports several programming models including JAX-WS, 
JBI, SCA, and CORBA. It is designed for flexible deployment in a variety of 
containers including Spring-based, JBI, SCA, Servlet and J2EE containers. This 
broad range of flexibility makes it possible to create and integrate Web 
services and legacy services using a single framework.


Incubation Disclaimer
=====================
Apache Incubator CXF is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software 
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. 

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review 
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully 
endorsed by the ASF.
